## Overview

Restaurant page for Corralitos Pizza with some inspiration from their existing website. It was initially a project in the JavaScript section of the Odin Project.

## Features

- Single page application

> Each tab of the website updates the page through JavaScript rather than loading a separate page.

### Home

- Animated logo

> Different sections of the logo are animated to slide up at different rates when Home page is loaded.

### Gallery

- Full page image viewer

> Clicking a gallery item opens a full page modal to view a larger image. The modal includes 'previous' and
next 'next' buttons to cycle through the gallery without closing the modal for each image.

- Lazy loaded images

### Menu

- Revolving menu page styled like the official PDF menu

> Changing pages of the menu will rotate the element like an actual menu with the second page on the back instead
of loading each menu page individually.

### Contact

- Google maps iframe of restaurant location with pizza board slide-in animation

> When iframe has finished loading, it triggers an animation of a pizza board sliding in from the edge
with the iframe on top. The pizza board leaves the iframe in place while moving back out of the window.
